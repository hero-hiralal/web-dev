This a typical web-dev playground of Ermac. Would be a simple site with 4 sections such as
Home, Services, About, Account.

In this project we have to create a homepage of a company named "XL Solutions" which offers computer solutions from setting up a system to maintaining it.

In Services tab we have to specify 3 plans from the lowest just at 5000 INR, mid ranged 15k and the best at around 25k. 

About section will contain some info about the company with the social media handles and with a port folio of work.

Account section will have a form to login as well as a register link to redirect to the registation page. 

Color theme would be: Deep blue, light pink and purple.
